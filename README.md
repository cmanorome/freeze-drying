# Freeze Drying Process Animation

An interactive educational visualization showing how freeze drying (lyophilization) works at the molecular level. Built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

## üöÄ Features

- **Interactive Process Animation**: Visual representation of water molecules during each phase
- **Step-by-Step Controls**: Manual navigation through each stage of freeze drying
- **Real-Time Temperature & Pressure Monitoring**: Live display of conditions
- **Scientific Accuracy**: Based on actual freeze drying parameters and physics
- **Animated Molecular Behavior**: See water molecules freeze, sublimate, and turn to vapor
- **Educational Content**: Detailed explanations of each phase with scientific data

## üî¨ Process Phases Visualized

### 1. Initial State
- Room temperature sample with liquid water molecules
- Atmospheric pressure (1013 mbar)
- Molecules moving freely in liquid state

### 2. Freezing Phase (-40¬∞C to -80¬∞C)
- Rapid cooling forms ice crystal structures
- Water molecules arrange in crystalline patterns
- Animated ice crystal formation effects
- Cellular structure preservation

### 3. Primary Drying (Sublimation)
- Vacuum conditions (0.1-0.3 mbar)
- Ice crystals sublimate directly to vapor
- Animated molecule transitions from solid to gas
- Bypasses liquid phase completely
- Removes 95% of water content

### 4. Secondary Drying (Desorption)
- Temperature rises to 20-60¬∞C
- Removes remaining bound water molecules
- Final moisture content below 2%
- Heat source visualization

### 5. Complete
- Preserved, dried product
- Extended shelf life (2-25 years)
- 95%+ nutrient retention
